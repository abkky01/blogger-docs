# BloggerDocs
Here is the [resource](http://fassetar.github.io/blogger-docs) I'm working on. The purpose of this project is to investigate the [language of blogger](http://stackoverflow.com/q/1561846/1265036), there is [some documentation](https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/46888?hl=en&vid=1-635760613382654775-1039857130) is aviable on the variables or syntax but it is very little.

#Get started
Included in this project is the skeleton blogger template, and in it is the very minimal syntax you need to get started. 


#Plans for the future

 - Adding support to read blogs on mobile devices (taking your blog further with an app?)
 - Creating support for bootstrap, angular-ui, and in a single page application.
